# The-LSFVFA-Method
The training process of the E-puck robot in various environments is captured in four videos. Two of these videos, namely LSFVFA-Training1 and LSFVFA-Training2, demonstrate the sequential training steps of the robot. The remaining two videos, LSFVFA-Test and Qlearning-Test, showcase the robot's performance in a different environment.

In these videos, visual cues are used to represent specific aspects of the robot's behavior. The red and blue axes represent the robot's location, providing a visual reference for its position within the environment. Additionally, the green axis visually indicates the rotation angle of the robot at each state, allowing viewers to comprehend its orientation.

In summary, these videos provide a comprehensive visual demonstration of the E-puck robot's training and performance, offering valuable insights into its capabilities and behavior.
