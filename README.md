# The-LSFVFA-Method
There are two videos (LSFVFA-Training1 and LSFVFA-Training1) that show the train steps of the E-puck robot in the training environment.
Two videos (LSFVFA-Test and Qlearning-Test) show the performance of the E-puck robot in another environment. 
In the videos, the red and blue axes show the location of the robot, and the green axis shows the rotation angle of the robot in each state.
